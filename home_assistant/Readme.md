Place the sure_petflap.py in custom_components/sensor
Adjust the configuration, see sensors.yaml, binary_sensors.yaml and groups for tips.
You also need to install the sure python package, i have not uploaded it to the python repository yet, as i want more feedback on how well this is working.
To install i cloned this repository and went into home assistant :
from the source folder :
  pip install . -t /config/deps/
